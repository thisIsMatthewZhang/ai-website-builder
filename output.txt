        "I'll scaffold a practical, SEO- and conversion-focused plumbing website structure implemented with Astro and styled with TailwindCSS. 
        The pages list below gives route paths along with concise implementation notes for each page: suggested content sections, UI components (Hero, ServicesGrid, ContactForm, Testimonials, PricingTable), Tailwind utility hints, and mentions of Astro features (islands, partials, frontmatter, server endpoints for forms, and JSON-LD for SEO). 
        Use this as the blueprint to implement .astro pages and shared components in src/components, global Tailwind config, and deploy to a platform like Vercel or Netlify."
